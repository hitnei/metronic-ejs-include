    After a set amount of time(10 seconds set for demo), a dialog is shown to the user with the option to either log out
    now, or stay connected.
    If log out now is selected, the page is redirected to a logout URL. If stay connected is selected, a keep-alive URL
    is requested through AJAX.
    If no options is selected after another set amount of time, the page is automatically redirected to a timeout URL.
